## 🚧 Current Development Focus

### **Immediate Tasks (Next 2-3 Days)**

#### 1. **Database Setup** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
```bash
# Create database migrations
- PostGIS extension setup
- Tables creation with spatial indexes
- Foreign key relationships
- Sample data insertion
```

#### 2. **API Routes Implementation** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY  
```typescript
// Core endpoints needed
POST /api/v1/pathfinding/route
GET  /api/v1/rooms/search
GET  /api/v1/buildings
GET  /api/v1/navigation/directions
```

#### 3. **Data Processing Execution** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
```bash
# Process the actual shapefile data
cd data-processing
python scripts/process_shapefiles.py --validate --export-geojson --export-json
```

#### 4. **Mobile App Bootstrap** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
```bash
# Initialize React Native environment
cd mobile
npm install
npx react-native init --template react-native-template-typescript
```
